# 📱 Material 3 SMS App

A modern Android SMS sending application built using **Jetpack Compose**, **Material 3 (Material You)**, and **MVVM Architecture**.

This project demonstrates clean architecture principles, reactive state management using `StateFlow`, runtime permission handling, and proper separation of concerns.

It is designed as a scalable foundation for production-level SMS-based Android applications.

# 🏗 Architecture Overview

This project follows **MVVM (Model–View–ViewModel)** architecture.


### 🔹 UI Layer
- Built entirely using Jetpack Compose
- Observes `StateFlow` from ViewModel
- Reacts automatically to state changes

### 🔹 ViewModel Layer
- Holds UI state using `MutableStateFlow`
- Exposes immutable `StateFlow`
- Contains UI-related logic

### 🔹 Repository Layer
- Handles SMS sending logic
- Communicates with `SmsManager`
- Returns success/failure result
